# Railway Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue: Package Lock File Out of Sync

The error occurs because `package-lock.json` doesn't match the updated `package.json` after adding new dependencies.

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Use the Updated Dockerfile (Recommended)
The `Dockerfile.railway` has been updated to handle this automatically:
- It now uses `npm install` instead of `npm ci`
- It doesn't require a pre-existing lock file

### Option 2: Update Your Local Lock File
Run this locally to update your lock file:

```bash
# Remove old lock file
rm package-lock.json

# Install dependencies to create new lock file
npm install

# Commit and push changes
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Update package-lock.json"
git push
```

### Option 3: Use the Simple Dockerfile
Use `Dockerfile.simple` instead of `Dockerfile.railway`:
- Even simpler configuration
- Handles dependency issues automatically

## Railway Configuration

### Environment Variables to Set:
```
DATABASE_URL=<your-railway-mongodb-connection-string>
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-railway-deployment
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-byte-hex-encryption-key-railway-deployment
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-railway-app.railway.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret-railway-deployment
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```

### After Deployment:
```bash
# Set up database
railway run node scripts/railway-setup.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Build Still Fails:
1. **Check Railway logs** for specific error messages
2. **Try using `Dockerfile.simple`** instead
3. **Verify all environment variables** are set
4. **Check if MongoDB service** is running in Railway

### Test Commands:
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health

# Test frontend
curl https://your-app.railway.app/
```
